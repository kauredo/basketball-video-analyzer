## üéØ What This App Does

This app solves the common problem of **creating organized video libraries for team analysis** across multiple games, opponents, and seasons. Instead of recreating category systems for every video, coaches can:

- ‚úÖ Create project-specific clip libraries with consistent organization
- ‚úÖ Build hierarchical category systems (parent categories with subcategories)
- ‚úÖ Save category structures as reusable presets across projects
- ‚úÖ Cut specific plays and automatically organize them in project folders
- ‚úÖ **Jump to specific times** using HH:MM:SS search (new feature!)
- ‚úÖ Export organized clip libraries to share with teams, players, or staff
- ‚úÖ Maintain consistent video analysis workflows throughout the season

Perfect for building "Opponent Scouting" projects with reusable category presets, or creating "Player Development" libraries that maintain the same organizational structure across multiple sessions.
